## Description

The Note Taker application is crafted to offer a simple and efficient solution for writing and saving notes. Whether you need to organize your thoughts or keep track of tasks, this app streamlines the process, allowing you to focus on what matters most.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in navigating and utilizing Express.js.
